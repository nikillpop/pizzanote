Pizza Note - by Pizza Squeeze
======

This is a replacement for the Flipnote Hatena service for the DSi which has ended.
It's written in Python 2.7, and requires Twisted and Zope.
The base of the source code was made by pbsds @ http://pbsds.net/ and you can find the original source code here https://github.com/pbsds/hatena-server

To use it, simply run server.py.
On the DSi, set the proxy settings to point to this server on port 8080, then access Flipnote Studio as usual.
